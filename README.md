Statistical Analysis

Use your data to determine whether the mean or the median better summarizes the data.
	In this case the mean is the more accurate way to find an expectation for projections
	for the future and make sure we are setting goals to high or low.

Use your data to determine if there is more variability with successful or unsuccessful
campaigns. Does this make sense? Why or why not?

This makes sense to use variability to understand how much of a possible gap there is between the 
values. This could be marker to drill deeper into why there is such a diference.
